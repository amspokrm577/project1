What did you like about this website?

I liked the theme of the website, with art being the main focus. It looks as though it is for an audience that is into art and graphic design. It follows a very standard website layout with the navigation being at the top and the main content being at the body. The color choices look very suitable for any kind of color visibility. 
Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
Which has a better user experience (and why)?

	My website features a lot of content that could make the user distracted while this site doesnâ€™t go overboard in its user interface. I would say that some of my pages look more attractive, but beauty is subjective to the viewer. 
Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

This code has very clear navigation within links and images which conform to the guidelines set by the project writeup. 
if not, suggest some specific improvements

Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
were semantically appropriate elements selected

Everything was semantically appropriate for this project. Nothing strayed out of the project guidelines, or the reading. 

is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
Most of everything that is styles is centrally contained in a .css folder. This folder spares as much content as possible to apply to as many similar features as possible. Ex. The navigation bar is the same for every .html file as defined in the .css file. 
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
	The only thing I would work with is labeling in the html for users with vision impairment. This can come in the form of aria labels or other labeling schemes. Some of the pages could define their purpose more. Perhaps the about page could contain a little more information.
